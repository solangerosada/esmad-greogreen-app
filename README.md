# GeoGreen

GeoGreen (GG) is an application whose main focus is to inform its users of the points
nearest recycling centers (common ecopoints, bins, clothing deposits, among others). Through
Geolocation of the device, the application returns the closest points to the user. The
GG also has a range of extra features, including:

- **“Informer”** of deposits of each residence. - Where do I put a Pizza Box? – must put
I live in an undifferentiated ecopoint because the greasy cardboard cannot be recycled;
- **Account and Statistics of Deposited Waste** - User can register all waste
that recycles and consult the waste history at any time or view a graph that
informs in which month you saved more;
- **Notifications** - “New Ecopoint Available in your parish!”, “This Month has not yet been recycled…”,
"Do you know that..."
